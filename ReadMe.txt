 ============

This is a super simple Black Jack game that I created to get my feet wet with DirectX9. 

To compile you'll need to first clone my game utilities repository, which has all the code that 
interfaces with directx (Not sure why I didn't keep everything in one repo...doh!). Black Jack
will need to link in the game utilities lib to work. See my game utilities repo for info on 
how to compile it.
